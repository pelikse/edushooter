  EnemyDescription: The Exploder is one of the fastest enemy types and can tank more
    shots than the Roller. However, they do not deal damage on touch. Instead, they
    <color=#ffb5df>explode after arming for a second</color>.
  EnemyTips: You can intentionally bait an Exploder by moving close and then running
    away. Their explosion can also damage other enemies, so you can use them to your
    advantage.
