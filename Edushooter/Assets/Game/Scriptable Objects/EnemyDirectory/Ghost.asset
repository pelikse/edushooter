  EnemyDescription: The Ghost is uninhibited in its movement, it can <color=#ffb5df>pass
    through obstacles</color>. But besides that, they aren't an issue.
  EnemyTips: Since enemy outlines are always visible, pay attention to moving outlines
    inside walls. Teleports don't do much against the Ghost unlike other enemies.
