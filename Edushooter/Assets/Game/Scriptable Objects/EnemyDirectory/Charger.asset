  EnemyDescription: The Charger only spawns on the last wave on high difficulty.
    It's a powerful enemy with the highest health in the game. The shield in front
    of it blocks <color=#ffb5df>ALL BULLETS</color>, and it can charge at the player
    once in a while.
  EnemyTips: You can attempt to damage it by shooting it from behind when it's stunned
    after charging. Use your teleport and obstacles to cut off direct paths towards
    you.
