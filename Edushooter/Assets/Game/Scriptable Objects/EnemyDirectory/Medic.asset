  EnemyDescription: The Medic is a special unit. It doesn't deal damage and keeps
    it distance from the player. However, it <color=#ffb5df>heals nearby enemies
    and gives them a shield</color>.
  EnemyTips: Take down the Medic first, as their aura can bolster other enemies in
    its radius. They have no offensive options so you can safely get close to attack.
