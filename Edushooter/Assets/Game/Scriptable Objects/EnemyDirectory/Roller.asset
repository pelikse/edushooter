  EnemyDescription: The roller is the standard enemy type. They're the most numerous
    enemy and are straightforward, just running at the player and <color=#ffb5df>dealing
    damage when close</color>.
  EnemyTips: Rollers move slightly slower than you and tend to obstruct each other
    in crowds. Keep moving away and shoot at them to whittle them down.
